            <p>"Your eyes hold the depth I long for â€”
A place where silence speaks louder than fear.

An uncertainty that doesn't frighten, But cradles me like something l've always known."</p>

Forever and always, my love for you will flourish, a never-ending tapestry of devotion, woven from the threads of my very being."</p>
